# FeatureScript Sync Configuration
#
# This file configures the sync between local files and Onshape Feature Studios.
#
# IMPORTANT: Get folder/document IDs from Onshape URLs:
#   Folder: https://k2-sports.onshape.com/documents?nodeId={folder_id}&resourceType=folder
#   Document: https://k2-sports.onshape.com/documents/{document_id}/w/{workspace_id}/e/{element_id}

# Base URL for your Onshape instance
base_url: "https://k2-sports.onshape.com"

# Folder-based sync
# Each Onshape document becomes a local folder with .document.json metadata
folders:
  - name: "EOC Featurescripts"
    folder_id: "fe3ff54b1d12a3a8491215c6"
    local_path: "./onshape"
    recursive: true
    exclude:
      - "_archive/*"
      - "_test*"
