# Standard Library (std/)

Core geometry, math, and utility modules for FeatureScript development. These are reference implementations - study patterns here before writing new code.

## Key Modules

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `math.fs` | Predicates, matrix ops, mathematical utilities |
| `surfaceGeometry.fs` | Surface creation and manipulation primitives |
| `curveGeometry.fs` | Curve operations and editing |
| `nurbsUtils.fs` | NURBS curve and surface utilities |
| `geometry.fs` | Core geometry types and operations |
| `coordSystem.fs` | Coordinate system utilities |

## Surface Operations

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `offsetSurface.fs` | Surface offset with normal distance |
| `fillSurface.fs` | Fill surface bounded by curve loops |
| `ruledSurface.fs` | Ruled surface (linear loft) between curves |
| `isoparametricCurve.fs` | Extract curves at constant parameter |

## Curve Operations

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `editCurve.fs` | Curve editing operations |
| `offsetCurveOnFace.fs` | Offset curves on face surfaces |
| `splineUtils.fs` | Spline-specific utilities |

## Utilities

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `queryVariable.fs` | Query system utilities |
| `manipulator.fs` | Interactive manipulator creation |
| `variable.fs` | Variable management |
| `mateConnector.fs` | Mate connector utilities |

## Usage Pattern

```featurescript
import(path : "onshape/std/math.fs");
import(path : "onshape/std/surfaceGeometry.fs");

// Functions are directly available
const normalized = normalize(myVector);
const dist = evDistance(context, {...});
```

## Notes

- 22 files total (includes some generated `.gen.fs` files)
- Follow patterns here for type definitions, predicates, and exports
- All public functions use `export` keyword
