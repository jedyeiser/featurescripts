# FeatureScript Sync Configuration
#
# This file configures the sync between local files and Onshape Feature Studios.
#
# IMPORTANT: Get folder/document IDs from Onshape URLs:
#   Folder: https://k2-sports.onshape.com/documents?nodeId={folder_id}&resourceType=folder
#   Document: https://k2-sports.onshape.com/documents/{document_id}/w/{workspace_id}/e/{element_id}

# Base URL for your Onshape instance
# Use "https://cad.onshape.com" for standard Onshape
# Use your company URL for enterprise (e.g., "https://k2-sports.onshape.com")
base_url: "https://k2-sports.onshape.com"

# Folder-based sync (recommended)
# Each Onshape document becomes a local folder
# Preserves folder hierarchy from Onshape
folders:
  - name: "Core Library"
    folder_id: "fe3ff54b1d12a3a8491215c6"
    local_path: "./featurescripts/core"
    recursive: true
    exclude:
      - "_archive/*"
      - "_test*"

# Legacy: Single document sync (for backwards compatibility)
# Use this if you need to sync specific documents outside folders
documents: []
  # Example:
  # - name: "My Feature"
  #   document_id: "abc123..."
  #   workspace_id: "main"
  #   local_path: "./featurescripts/standalone"

settings:
  # Create backup of local files before pull overwrites them
  backup_on_pull: true
  backup_dir: "./.sync-backups"

  # File extension for FeatureScript files
  file_extension: ".fs"

  # Default workspace when not specified (usually "main")
  default_workspace: "main"

  # Verbose logging
  verbose: false
