# Gordon Surface Feature (gordonSurface/)

Gordon surface interpolation through curve networks. Creates smooth surfaces that pass exactly through a grid of U and V direction curves.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `gordonSurface.fs` | Main feature implementation |
| `gordonCurveCompatibility.fs` | Make curves compatible (degree, knots) |
| `gordonKnotOps.fs` | Piegl & Tiller knot algorithms |
| `modifyCurveEnd.fs` | Curve end modification, Frenet frames |
| `interiorCurves.fs` | Interior curve generation |
| `scaledCurve.fs` | Scaled curve creation, transition functions |
| `simplifySurface.fs` | Surface simplification |
| `constEnums.fs` | Constants and enumerations |

## Mathematical Complexity

Gordon surfaces require:
- **Curve compatibility**: All curves must have same degree and compatible knot vectors
- **Intersection consistency**: U curves must intersect V curves at consistent parameters
- **Skinning**: Interpolate through curve network using tensor product surfaces

## Key Algorithms

- **Degree elevation**: Raise curve degree to match network
- **Knot unification**: Merge knot vectors for compatibility
- **Frenet frames**: For curve end modifications and continuity
- **P&T algorithms**: Piegl & Tiller knot insertion/refinement

## Dependencies

- `std/` - Core geometry modules
- `tools/` - BSpline utilities (originally extracted from this codebase)

## Usage Pattern

```featurescript
import(path : "gordonSurface/gordonSurface.fs", version : "");
import(path : "gordonSurface/gordonCurveCompatibility.fs", version : "");

// Make curves compatible before Gordon surface creation
var compatibleCurves = makeCurvesCompatible(uCurves, vCurves);
```

## Notes

- Original source for `tools/bspline_knots.fs` and `tools/frenet.fs`
- Mathematically intensive - careful attention to numerical stability
- Curves must form valid network (proper intersections)
